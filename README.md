## quizApp
quizApp is a simple app which allows its users to add truth and false questions - and then start a quiz with questions added.

The app was built for the course [https://www.eit.lth.se/kurs/eitg01](EITG01 Dator- och telekommunikation) at Lunds Tekniska HÃ¶gskola. 

### Disclaimer
quizApp is very rudimentary, and lack many features. This is just a proof of concept.
